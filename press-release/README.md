# Homework: GA Press Release!! 📰

Now that we've learned an awesome amount of CSS, it's time to put it all together. For this homework you'll be writing your own HTML and CSS to create a press release for General Assembly 💪

### You'll need to:
- Attach the stylesheet `style.css` to `index.html`
- Write the HTML for the page, using the content in `content.txt`, and style it!!!
    - Use at least one pseudo-class or pseudo-element!!!
    - Write a media query for desktop and make sure it's adaptive to different screen sizes!
    - Optional: use a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) or two!
- Upload it to BitBalloon!

### Wait, what's BitBalloon?

[BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/) is a super handy and easy-to-use tool for deploying small static sites quickly and easily. When you're done with your site, just drag your index file and your stylesheet file into one of the drop zones on BitBalloon and your site will be hosted!

#### We will showcase the best few press releases... 🤔 Good luck!!
